# my-product-catalog by Kewin Krasowski for Junior Web Developer position

## Description

This is a web application built with React that allows users to search, filter, and sort products from an external API while being offered some extra features such as a simplistic login system, error messages, caching API responses and having a loading spinner.

I have completed all of the requirements including the bonus points in the task specification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed on your machine.
- Git (optional) for cloning the repository.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the application locally on your machine:

**Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

**Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project's root directory and install the necessary dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`. Run one of the following commands:

npm install **or** yarn install

**Start the Development Server:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

npm start

This will launch the application locally, and you can access it in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Stop the Server:** To stop the development server, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.
